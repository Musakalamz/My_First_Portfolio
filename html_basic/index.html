    <h1>Welcome to My First HTML Portfolio</h1>

    <h2>About This Project</h2>
    <p>
      This is my first HTML project where I'm learning the fundamentals of web
      development. Through this journey, I'm discovering how HTML works as a
      markup language and how it structures content on the web. This project
      represents the beginning of my web development skills.
    </p>

    <p>
      HTML, which stands for HyperText Markup Language, is the standard markup
      language for creating web pages. It describes the structure of a web page
      using elements and tags. Each element tells the browser how to display the
      content, whether it's a heading, paragraph, image, or link.
    </p>

    <h3>What I'm Learning</h3>
    <p>
      Throughout this project, I'm gaining hands-on experience with various HTML
      elements and attributes. I'm learning about the Document Object Model
      (DOM), which represents the structure of HTML documents. Understanding the
      DOM helps me see how browsers interpret and display web content.
    </p>

    <p>
      Web development is an exciting field that combines creativity with
      technical skills. By mastering HTML first, I'm building a solid foundation
      that will support my future learning in CSS for styling and JavaScript for
      interactivity. This step-by-step approach ensures I understand each
      technology thoroughly.
